#UV5R and its family
Any ham knows about UV5R, an amazingly low-cost handheld radio. It's avaialble on ebay or amazon for 17-22GBP. It actually has 7 generations, where the UK version and most US versions are the first gen. Equipped with 1800mAh, it can last a few days purely on listening mode or about 3 or 4 hours if you are constantly talking on air with a high power VHF channel. 

Some may ask about the difference between UV5R  and its family. I played with UV5R, UV5R5, and GT3TP MK III. I'd say UV5R5 is basically a copy of UV5R with one less button and a flat display which is more vulnerable. GT3TP has a totally different battery pack and a different keypad which does not look as solid as the UV5Rs. GT3TP has more power which in theory should give you 26% more coverage, it also has a different antenna made by a third company. However I tried to install it on my UV5R and see the spectrum on an SDR, I could not tell a difference in its gain. 

In short, if you want a solid quality handheld, UV5R is of your choice. It indeed does not look like a cheap Chinese sweat labour product. It is a piece of equipment that is designed to last for at least 10 years under various environment. 

If you wish to get an even better bargain, I'd recommend UV5R 7th gen which comes with a huge battery pack, 8W of max transmit power and USB direct charging compatibility. It is only available in China at a price of around 200CNY (ca 20GBP). 

#Long distance transmission tests in Soton

DK, a mate of mine and I tested the max range in a city like Soton. I was holding a UV5R and his is UV5R5 which is basically the same. We use 145.350MHz with high power. We started walking away from the riverside park [50.931840, -1.376140], til we reach St Denys Road Bridge[50.924474, -1.379097] and the A27 Bridge[50.937654, -1.364594]. The distance is 1mil covering both park and residentials. 

Later we carried another test where DK drives home while receives my signal. He had no problem at all all the way til he is home which is 1.1mil away. I start to suffer from noise when I go into my room or he gets into his. The path is full of houses. 

So basically, you can expect UV5R to work over 1mil in a typical British city. 
# UV5R Dissembled
DK took the UV5R5 apart, and here are some pics. 

What surprised us was that the backplate where the battery is attached on is made of a solid piece of metal rather than plastic. I have to say the build quality of Baofeng UV5R is simply not like a cheap Chinese product. 

#A dipole for a handheld
I made a dipole antenna using some copper wires from a transformer from an old TV. Attached to a wood rod which was a curtain rail. Then the two wires go to a female SMA connector. 

It worked surprisingly well, I could hear from the dipole equipped handheld in my room while if only with the original antenna I have to go to my backyard. 

DK again took the original antenna apart and here is how it looks.
