#Intro
DW1000 is a UWB positioning chip developed by Decawave. 

DWM1000 is a system-on-chip integration of DW1000 +a clock source+ a wide band antenna. 
#Preformance
The document claims that it has a max range of 300m and an accuracy of 10cm was reported by some other users. Due to a rather low power consumption, this chip can even be powered by AA batteries. 
#Hardware
The breakout board can be found here. This breakout works with Arduino Mini Pro 8MHz 3.3V version. We have tested that the chip works well with the cheap Chinese copy of Mini Pro and only cost CNY17 (ca 1pounds/ USD$1.5). 

Or you can use my the other board which has an 8-bit ATmega328 microprocessor soldered onto the board itself. 

#Coding
I used Thero's library for Arduino. Simply go to Arduino IDE and search DW1000 in library manager. 

The library provides you with multiple modes to work with:

* MODE_ LONGDATA_ RANGE_LOWPOWER (basically this is 110 kb/s data rate, 16 MHz PRF and long preambles)
* MODE_ SHORTDATA_ FAST_LOWPOWER (basically this is 6.8 Mb/s data rate, 16 MHz PRF and short preambles)
* MODE_ LONGDATA_ FAST_LOWPOWER (basically this is 6.8 Mb/s data rate, 16 MHz PRF and long preambles)
* MODE_ SHORTDATA_ FAST_ACCURACY (basically this is 6.8 Mb/s data rate, 64 MHz PRF and short preambles)
* MODE_ LONGDATA_ FAST_ACCURACY (basically this is 6.8 Mb/s data rate, 64 MHz PRF and long preambles)
* MODE_ LONGDATA_ RANGE_ACCURACY (basically this is 110 kb/s data rate, 64 MHz PRF and long preambles)

where PRF is the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of data transmissions with the DW1000. Either

* TX_ PULSE_ FREQ_16MHZ (i.e. 16 MHz)
* TX_ PULSE_ FREQ_64MHZ (i.e. 64 MHz) 

has to be chosen.

Note that the 16 MHz setting is more power efficient, while the 64 MHz setting requires more power, but also delivers slightly better transmission performance (i.e. on communication range and timestamp accuracy) (see DWM1000 User Manual, section 9.3).

Corresponding to different frame structure thus different transmission rate hence different range/power/accuracy.

We report a working distance of 70m with an accuracy of 30cm with LONGDATA_ RANGE_ LOWPOWER mode without any optimisation. 
#possible ways to improve covering range

* a better grounding -> better antenna performance
#Fresnel Zone
In RF propaganda, instead of using Line of Sight (LoS) rule, Fresnel Zone has to be taken into consideration.

Here is a calculator from RF cafe: https://www.everythingrf.com/rf-calculators/fresnel-zone-calculator

When 60% of the 1st Fresnel Zone is clear, we consider the space to be safe for our LoS equivalent. 

If we are talking about 100m at 4GHz, it means that we have to make sure that 60% space is free in an eclipse forming around the antenna path with a Radius of ca 1m. 


#Issues with Designing
* Thermal drift: DWM1000 doesn't have a TCXO thus a 3-5m drift is observed before thermal equilibrium is reached
* The range is approx. 90m rather than 300m.

#Todos 
* Add MPU9250 (http://www.invensense.com/products/motion-tracking/9-axis/mpu-9250/) + LPS25HB (http://www2.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/mems-and-sensors/pressure-sensors/lps25hb.html) sensors. Offering 3-axis gyroscope, acceloremeter, compass and a 1-axis barometer. 

#Refs
If you are developing DW1000 with an arduino, plz use Thoroto's library. 

If you are using STM32 platform, KitSprout's kit is your choice.
