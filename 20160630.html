#AJA ATC Orion 5 Maintaniance Dairy 
A single wafer magnetron sputtering system by AJA international. This system is evacuated with 3 pumps: one turbo for the load-lock, one turbo for the main chamber and one 2nd stage mechanical pump for the main chamber turbo pump. The mechanical pump is a rotary vane oil seal pump in Southampton Nanocentre.

We recently experienced an oil leakage with the mechanical pump, not as bad as BP's Mexican Gulf incidence but still very bad as to put the tool offline for a couple of weeks. 
The major reason causing it is the pressure difference during an evacuation process, causing the mechanical pump to fail and sucked oil into the chamber. Without knowing it, sputtering process was performed making the whole chamber burned and the wafer coated with a mixture of oil + silicon nitride. 

Now the mechanical pump is replaced with a dry pump. Yet we dont know what a differential pipeline is which has a bit of oil in it, since it works well, we have no intention in replacing the PTFE pipelines now. 
#Cleaning 
##Chamber IPA cleaning
From the [Official manual]
```
Inspect the inside of the chamber and main o-ring seal area for dust, fingerprints or particulates. Use a vacuum cleaner with a clean crevice tool attachment to remove particulate. Use clean IPA on a lint-free cloth to wipe aff dust and fingerprints. Do not use vacuum grease without consulting the factory first.
```
##Plasma cleaning
We also performed an O2 bias clean to get rid of the remaining oil. To further clean it we are performing a a 10min of Ti sputtering (300W, approx. 82nm, 30mTorr) with 10min Ar bias clean for 4 times. 

Chamber cleaned and coated with Al. The black target cover looks like before cleaning. It is an Al target.

##Target cleaning
In our case, the burned carbon was left on the target surviving IPA wiping. We have to perform an O2 plasma clean on the target. However we can't do it in other tools like RIE tool. Because a target is typically indium bonded on a copper plate, and copper is extremely diffusive, no one likes it in their tool. 

Here is what I did - to fill the chamber with O2 and use Si3N4 gun to strike it. At 80mTorr, 100W, the oxygen plasma has a really low voltage (2-4V), glowing yellow-white (RGB#F7F6C3).

#Cleaning the shield 
We recently experienced a short circuit while running a recipe causing the DC power supply to fail. A piece of metal is believed to have fallen off from the shield, making a contact from the target to the ground. The fuse was gone, but still we found 4 transistors and a few capacitors/diodes on the high voltage side of the DC supply were gone. 

We found a flake of melt on the back side of the shield. We sandblasted the shield, a half cm dia. metal bar came off from the surface. We strongly recommend
- Do not use different metal with the same shield since different thermal expansion coefficient can cause the flake to drop off
- sandblasing the shield every a few um of deposition
 
#Standard Operation Procedure
##Main chamber pumpdown
- Close the chamber top and secure it with a clamp.
- Make sure the chamber vent valve is CLOSED.
- Make sure the valve between the main chamber and load lock (or loading door) is CLOSED.
- Fully open the turbo isolation/throttle gate valve.
- Turn “ON” the VACUUM PUMPS breaker switch at the MAIN CHAMBER PD30A control box.
- When the VACUUM PUMPS switch is turned “ON” both the mechanical pump and the turbo start simultaneously.
- View the vacuum readout on the main chamber vacuum gauge controller to ensure the pressure is going down. Continue to pump until the desired vacuum level is achieved.
##Vent
- Open the main throttle/isolation valve fully
- Turn the main chamber vacuum breaker off. This will shut off turbo and mechanical pumps and activate the turbopump's delayed vent valve. This valve will completely vent the system in about 5-6 minutes. Once the chamber pressure has reached 150 Torr, it is also possible to speed up the venting by opening the main vent valve. Be sure to shut off the vent valve when the chamber has vented to conserve N2. 
-Lift chamber top. 
#Silicon Nitride
Care must be taken when working with silicon nitride target - it can't stand a high power density, see this [paper]. 

It seems that silicon nitride does not strike with nitrogen atmosphere, I used argon at 90mTorr and striked at 100W. After 10s or so, I changed the chamber pressure to 2mTorr. It can stably deposit and the current is about 1A. 

#Other points
- Insulating substrate/ substrate with insulating coatings/ metals which can oxidize must use RF biasing. 
- When using gettering targets such as Ti, it's necessary to flow Ar into the chimney to prevent a pressure drop.
- A power over the limit will cause the target to break into 2 pieces. Check the publications for power density. For example, Diamond and Related Materials 1777-1784 reported a max. power of 150W on a Silicon Nitride target on this tool.
