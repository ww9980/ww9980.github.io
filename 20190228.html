#The Hongqi
In fact, nobody in China wants to buy a Hongqi L5, the most expensive Chinese car on market. Hongqis are considered the cars for those in power. Most people in China would be happy owning a VW, Passat or Tiguan if possible. 

Hongqi’s history is full of replicas of western saloons. The very first Hongqi was a chimaera between Simca Vedette body and Mercedes 190 engine, totally hand-crafted. It was followed by a number of replicas of the Chrysler Imperial during Mao’s cultural revolution because there was no other car to copy from. In the 80s, thanks to Nixon’s visit, a new donor Audi 100 was picked. The Audi 100-derived Hongqis was in production until 2005. 

The Hongqi L5 is a reinspired classic Hongqi (imperial based). You won’t dare to dream of buying it, actually not even think of test driving it. To test drive an L5, you have to pay $150k deposit. The first buyers of L5 include Dewang Cao whose factory builds windscreen for every single car in the world. Dong Jin, a movie start, George Clooney equivalent. 

Recently, Hongqi tried to promote their car to the working class by introducing a Hongqi H5, a 5 door family saloon based on Mazda 3, but it does not sell well despite being a former privilege class’s exclusive. 

#Chongqing
Chongqing was once the capital of the Republic of China during the Sino-Japanese war. This mountainous city sits at where a major branch joins the Yangtze River. 

The claimed population of 33 million was referring to the entire Chongqing Municipal, roughly the size of Austria. The urban population is no more than 50% of this number making it one of the mega cities in China. 

Chongqing was a major site of civil war during the Cultural Revolution. Thanks to the mass amount of weapons stored here due to being the capital during the Sino-Japanese war, Chongqing people drive tanks and use machine guns to kill each other. Mass graves are located in Shapingba and Jiangbei. 

Again because of the war-time industry, Chongqing became the Motown of China. However, it’s not the only one. Because of the planned economy during the Soviet time, every province (similar to every country in the EU) has its own motor company. After Deng’s reform and opening to the world, the provincial governments decided that they want to protect their own industry by imposing taxes towards buying cars from other provinces. The most famous Chongqing-made vehicle to me is Fulu, the 3-wheel car that Hammond drove in the episode, and its derivates.

#May’s Mercedes S class
Indeed, Mercedes S class was once the favourite of Chinese renowned businessman during the 90s. More specifically, it’s the 600SEL or W140. In China, it earned itself a nickname ‘The tiger-head Benz’. In the 90s, S class basically dominated the world of luxury saloon market globally. 

You will fall in love with it if you had a W140 in the 90s. It was a time that people have no radar technology to assist parking, so Mercedes decided that they will add two small benchmarking poles. When you open the boot, a small handle smoothly stretches out below the Mercedes logo. 

You can often still see well-kept W140 on some classic car shows in China. It’s an icon for the first generation of riches in the 90s. 

#The Chinese driving test
Hammond’s short video of balling fists, squatting and weighting is NOT how you pass a driving test. In fact, it is just to check your physical condition. Equivalent to ‘Do you have any health condition that prevents you from driving as per defined by DVLA’. 

The actual full Chinese driving test, from my experience, is useless. You have to do a bay parking, a side parking, and a 10-min on-road test. The parkings are scored by computer. 

In the early 2000s, if you can’t be bothered, you can pay a 300 CNY to bribe for a pass if you have a relative who works there. But nowadays you can’t. 

#Motorways in China
China is building motorways at an amazing speed, and remember the fact that the first motorway in China was built in 1988, not 1958 (UK) or 1911(USA). 

This is because – every motorway in China is subject to charges. Typically, it’s 0.50 CNY per km (5p per mile, 7c per mile). The government joins with some banks to invest in building a motorway, the motorway is only free to the public after 15-45 years. Due to the poverty in mid-west China, motorway investments hardly earn a penny. This is why in the film, the three find it so hard to refuel at a service station in Guizhou (a mid-west province). If you have a plan to travel in the sea-side provinces, you will find that the motorways are nice and clean, every service station is staffed, and all staffs are so humble and polite. They have to – the motorway company has a camera in every shop and kiosk, if an employee is found not doing their best to pleasure their customer, they will lose this well-paid job. You will also find it surprising that only a few tolls have automated tollgates – why? Why would you bother saving a penny on the toll girl if you earn a million per day? 

I HATE the flashings. It’s, like they said, disturbing and giving you epilepsy. The authority CAN and does put them on every road they like for no reason. I remember riding in my dad’s car passing a gantry of flashes where there were a good 100m of continuous potholes. Why??

#Hammond’s Northstar failure
Remarkable engine yet it has its own fatal fault: head gasket. I’m not repeating what is already on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northstar_engine_series#Head_gasket_issues). I reckon Hammond had this issue. 

#The 24 curves
The 24 curves were built in 1935. In WW2, the American supplies have to go from Burma to Kunming (China’s Yunnan’s capital), then to Chongqing (then known as Chungking) via what is known as Ledo Road. 

The 24 curves was repaired by the US troops. It’s a 4 km journey, but horizontally only 350m. With a descent of 250m at 60 degrees, this road takes 6-8 mins to complete but claimed over 4000 lives in construction and transport. 

However, this heroic piece of history was forgotten until 2002, a historian discovered the location of this road in the picture. 

Today, this road is little used but still open to the public. Geohash code: wkdfcuwpv06g.

#A show not available in just one country

Yes, true. Technically, watching TGT in China is ILLEGAL. Because Amazon China does not have a license to provide any video streaming service.
