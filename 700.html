Leybold Lab700 e-beam Evaporator (700 for short) is a deposition tool by Leybold, Germany. It's an 'old' tool to me - the control software is programmed in Visual Basic + MS Access database, the joypad has a rather low refresh LED display, the deposition controller (known as IC5) does not even have a flat display. A rather large chamber consumes a lot material - for example, 100nm gold layer equals to 3g of gold source. It can only do 1 wafer at a time - you might ask why does it need a huge chamber? - how should I know? (shrug)

Having said that does not mean that it's a tool that needs to go to garbage truck, because it's too big to fit. JK, the pros to this tool is the deposition controller actually monitors the thickness and deposition rate. 

It requires a lot of maintenance if not using properly. Aluminum is a nice metal however, it requires a much higher power to deposit using this tool. Upto 3500W as we used. And caution must be paid to the material source pocket - DO NOT USE TWO DIFFERENT KIND OF ALUMINUM!
If you wonder why, here is why:

![alt text](https://ww9980.github.io/images/IMG_20160913_163506R.jpg "Chamber with broken Al pieces")

Someone added Al plates into the source which was Al rods (fair, you can't tell what it was when it's melted). The purity of the plates are worse - it's harder to melt and poorer in thermal conductivity. When the power reaches 3000W, the temperature difference in the two materials is high enough - resulting an eruption releasing it. Causing mass pollution to the chamber.
