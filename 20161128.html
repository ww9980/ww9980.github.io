#Gases
Hydrogen - reduces fluorine concentration by combination to form HF. decreases the effective F/C ratio (by reacting with F to form
HF). This decreases the formation of SiF4 and subsequently decreases the
etch rate of both Si and SiO2. 
- The lower F/C ratio will enhance polymerization on silicon surfaces and inhibit
etching.
- On SiO2 surfaces, the presence of O2 in the film locally reacts with C (to form
CO and CO2) and minimizes polymerization.
- Subsequently the Si etch rate decreases, relative to the SiO2 etch rate which
improves the selectivity of SiO2 versus Si.

Oxygen - Increases fluorine concentration by combining with carbon
(CO, CO2) which would otherwise bond to fluorine (reacts with CF3 to
liberate F). can increase etch rate of Si etching (ie increases F/C ratio by reacting
with Carbon. By decreasing the carbon content, the oxide etch rate
decreases and subsequently increases the Si etch selectivity over oxide.

Argon - Inert (heavy) gas which can be added to ion enhance the
etching process (I.e. reactive ion etch). Because it is inert, this does
not effect the chemistry of the plasma.

Gas C:F Ratio SiO2:Si Selectivity

CF4 1:4 1:1

C2F6 1:3 3:1

C3F8 1:2.7 5:1

CHF3 1:2 10:1

##Metal Recipes
Au - Cl2

Al or Al2O3- BCl3/CCl4

Ti/SiNx- CF4

Cr-Cl2

###Aluminum Etching
1. Aluminum is not etched by fluorine, because AlF3 is not volatile. Chlorine or bromine are used, which are highly corrosive to equipment.

2. AlCl3, the etch product, is highly corrosive to the remaining aluminum film, and must be removed quickly after plasma etching.

3. Native aluminum oxide is an etch resistant barrier, which is removed by Hydrogen plasma reduction and/or by sputtering by bombardment with Argon at high energies.

4. Aluminum often has a few percent of Silicon or Copper. Silicon is removed by the Chlorine, Copper is not and requires a special process.
###Copper Etching
1. Copper does not form any volatile compounds with known plasma etch gases, and therefore cannot be RIE etched.

2. Copper can be sputter etched, but this technique has no selectivity.

3. Contamination of the fab with copper is serious concern.

The Damascene process has become an attractive enabling method for
patterning copper by CMP.
